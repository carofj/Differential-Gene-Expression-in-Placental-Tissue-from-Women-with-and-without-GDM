# Differential-Gene-Expression-in-Placental-Tissue-from-Women-with-and-without-GDM
The aim of this analysis was to identify differentially expressed genes in the postpartum placenta between women who developed GDM and the control group. Furthermore, it was sought to investigate the biological processes associated with the significantly differentially expressed genes.
